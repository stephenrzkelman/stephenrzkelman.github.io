# TODO for website

## Infrastructure/Coding Experience
- Convert to tsx

## Style
- Resume
    1. Set resume zoom to fit embed width
    2. Set embed height dynamically based on page width/resume width
- Better margins of the page (first letter of content touches edge of screen)

## General
- Fix page to load onto "Home"
    - or otherwise figure out a way, compatible with the new navbar setup,
      to get the page to load without being mostly empty
