# TODO for website

## Infrastructure/Coding Experience
- Minimize work for adding a page
    - Once page component is added to `pages/` directory, it should:
        - automatically populate on the navbar
        - have/get a corresponding path
        - work with navbar routing
- Convert to tsx

## Style
- Resume
    1. Set resume zoom to fit embed width
    2. Set embed height dynamically based on page width/resume width
